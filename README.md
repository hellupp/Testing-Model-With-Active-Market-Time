# Testing-Model-With-Active-Market-Time

The purpose of this work is to check one of the mathematical models of financial markets (the model with active market time) for adequacy from the point of view of calculating VaR and comparing it with the threshold value.
What was done: 
1. description and preparation of the data used;
2. determination of parameters for further calculations;
3. calculation of the fair price of the call option according to this model;
4. calculation of the value of VaR by the Monte Carlo method;
5. conducting a model adequacy test and drawing conclusions based on its results.
